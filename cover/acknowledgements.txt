Draft acknowledgement text:

The cats on the cover represent safe, secure, compartmentalisation (what is
safer or more secure than a cat in a box?).
Each cat is in a separate, isolated, compartment, in the model for which
CHERIoT was designed.

The cat photos were contributed by some wonderful people from the Fediverse.
